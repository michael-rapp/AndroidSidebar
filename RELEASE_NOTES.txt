Version: 		1.0.0 
Release date:	09.22.2014
--------------------------

The first stable release, which provides a Preference implementation, which provides a custom view 
implementation, which allows to show a sidebar, which overlaps the view's main content and can be 
shown or hidden in an animated manner. The implementation initially provides the following features:

    -   The sidebar can be located at left or right edge of its parent view.
        
    -   The width of the sidebar can be set relatively to the width of its parent view.
        Additionally, a maximum width can be defined.
    
    -   It is possible to specify an offset, which defines the amount of space the sidebar
        is visible even if it currently hidden. The offset can be set relatively to the
        width of the parent view and a maximum value can be defined.

    -   The way, the main content is animated, when the sidebar becomes shown or hidden,
        can be adjusted in many ways, including the possibility to move it or to resize it.

    -   The sidebar's state can be changed via drag gestures or by clicking the touch screen
        of the device. For each possibility multiple settings exist, e.g. it is possible to
        change the sensibility for recognizing drag gestures.

    -   The speed of the animation, which is used to show or hide the sidebar, can be chosen
        freely.

    -   The sidebar may render a semi-transparent shadow in front of the main content, whose
        appearance can be adjusted concerning size and color.

    -   It is possible to fade in a semi-transparent overlay, which is shown in front of the 
        main content, when the sidebar becomes shown. The transparency and color of the
        overlay can be adjusted.
